    <p> I like cats! They are very cool critters. They look cute doing pretty much anything, and some of them and surprisingly smart (or dumb, dumb cats are cool too). I know the names of some of the breeds of cats, which I will list below.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scottish Fold</strong></li>
    <li><em>Maine Coone</em></li>
    <li><ins>Ragdoll</ins></li>

  <p>Here's that list as a table!</p>

  <p>Here's a fun fact about how cats purr!</p>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.britannica.com/animal/cat">
   According to the latest research, purring likely stems from a special pad within the folds of a catâ€™s vocal cords, which adds an additional layer of fatty tissue that enables the folds to vibrate (purr) at low frequencies.
