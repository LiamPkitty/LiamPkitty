## Hi! I'm Liam!

My name is Liam, and I enjoy creating things! I have made both *2D and 3D digital art*, **_writing_**, and I even coded my own **website!**

The main things I draw are animals, abstract critters and backgrounds. I enjoy surreal and abstract art the most. I primarily want to learn more code.
At the moment I only know HTML and CSS, but I want to learn other languages like **Javascript**. I would like to develop a few games of my own in the future,
but I also really want to improve my website to look better. I do have some trouble with these sort of introductions as the questions are pretty broad, but
if you want to know anything *specific* about me feel free to ask!
